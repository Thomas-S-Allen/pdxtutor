# Teaching with Empathy

Science is a process through which we engage with and participate in the world.  It involves a conversation where we can ask the world questions and explore its mysteries.  I believe that with empathy and patience any student can learn to participate in this conversation, and as a teacher that is my goal.  By opening many avenues for students to engage with scientific content, they can begin to apply it in their lives and community.  I provide an in depth discussion of my teaching philosophy below in the post My [Teaching Philosophy](https://pdxtutor.netlify.com/post/my-teaching-philosophy/).
